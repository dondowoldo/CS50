#### Description:
Hello. I present you my final project I called House Browse. It's a Python/Django based web application, that allow its users to list their properties to rent to other people for short term stays.
Anyone who is signed up can book themselves a property or list their own property as well. If someone is thinking about booking a stay, the user can follow(like) the property to
give himself a quick access to the property whenever he/she comes back to make a booking. Every property has a comments section where users can comment, express themselves and share 
their experience with the property or landlord. If more and more people list their houses or apartments, The area may become a bit flooded and may overwhelm users with the amount of listings they 
see. Thats where a property filter comes in that allows users to specify their desired needs like location, price or availability etc to narrow down their selection.
When adding the property, the system checks the location of the property and if listing is successfully added, people can view its location on the map by simply going into the listings details and hovering over the image makes the view map button appear. Of course not all plans may turn out as we want to so the ability to cancel bookings, edit listings and removing listings is also included.
